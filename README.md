# React Native Learning!

This repo contains some small projects that I have developed in my journey of learning React Native.

## Using

```bash
git clone <project_url>

cd react-native-projects

cd <a project folder>

npm install

# run a development server
npm run start
# or
npx expo start

#‌ build using eas
npm install -g eas-cli # install eas cli tool

eas login # login to our account

eas build:configure #‌create eas.json file

eas build
# or
eas build -p android --profile preview #‌ to build a .apk file
```
